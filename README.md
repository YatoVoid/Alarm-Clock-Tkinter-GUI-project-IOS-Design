- Extract rar into a folder with same name. Then launch the .exe file. If you want to change the Ringtone it must be less than or equal to exactly 60 seconds
- just replace "ring.wav" file with any .wav format audio you want but make sure to have the name be exactly the same, "ring.wav"

- Note: If doesn't work probably Anti Virus scared of this file.
  
- Things to be added:
- Alarm Repetition, single - everyday is default
- Sort the time by there times, not from top to bottom
